A modular C++ image segmentation and classification framework based on feature extraction.
Originally designed for iris analysis, now supports general-purpose texture-based segmentation using LBP, DLBP, and Gabor features.

## Features
- Multi-channel (spectral) image support
- Dominant Local Binary Patterns (DLBP)
- KNN and K-Means classifiers
- Easy-to-extend feature extraction API
